This FlashStick is designed for programming the Raspberry Pi Compute Module versions 1, 3 and 3+

# How To Use

Operation should be as simple as:

1. Insert Compute Module 1,3/3+ into FlashStick.
2. Ensure Jumper is in position 2+3.
3. Plug into Computer.
4. Load USB Boot Software (Or use Balena Etcha) to boot the CM into Programming Mode.
5. Flash image like normal.
6. Unplug stick from computer.
7. Remove compute Module.
